This challenge was completed on a Ubuntu 22.04 VM running logstash 8.3.3.  

This pipeline configuration is written to input via stdin as the challenge only dictates a single line log for parsing which made that convenient for testing. However, included is an example realistic input for security telemetry as outlined using the HTTP Input filter. The message is then processed using a custom grok filter. The log conveniently translated in a way to parse, and leaving only key value pairs at the end - thus utilizing GREEDYDATA and the subsequent KV filter. Next the log is mutated to first remove redundant fields (I was particualarily unsure of this) for the sake of removing redundant data, then the fields requiring renaming are changed to match the requested values.  Finally a translate filter is applied to convert the value of the "severity" field to a corresponding description - multiple values included in the spirt of this representing a security log.  Also, the included JSON output shows testing with multiple severity values.  Finally that data using the File output plugin and added to a new line for readability using json_lines.
